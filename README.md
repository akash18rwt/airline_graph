Here the problem we will be working is in the aviation industry by applying the concepts of Graph Theory using Python.

We will be using NetworkX for creating and visualizing graphs. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

Some of the application of Graph Theory are:

•	Finding the best route for delivering posts

•	Representing networks of communication. For example, link structure of a website can be represented using directed graphs.

•	Determining the social behaviour of a person using their social connection graph

•	Travel planning as discussed in the airlines case study
